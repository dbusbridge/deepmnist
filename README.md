# deepmnist

## Introduction

This repo is a refactoring of the code found in the `TensorFlow r0.12` [deep mnist for experts tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/mnist/pros/index.html#deep-mnist-for-experts). I created this as a more verbose and modular version of the tutorial code so that I could better understand the components.

## Dependencies

## Setup

### Clone the repo
